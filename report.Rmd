## Introduction
This report introduces basic principles of "reproducible reports" as demonstrated by Rafael Irizarry at [his GitHub repo](https://github.com/rairizarry/murders). To illustrate, we use 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports.

We use the following library:
```{r load libraries, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

...and load our derived dataset:
```{r load data}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

## Murder rates by state

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state:

```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  coord_flip()
```
